- This project is a calendar application that allows users to create, edit, and delete events. Users can also view events for a specific day, week, or month.
- This project was created as part of the CS353 Team Project module at <a href="https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/">Maynooth University</a> in my first semester of my third year.
- The team consisted of 6 members (including me). I worked on all of the backend and migrating the frontend (HTML/CSS) to React.js.
